In JavaScript, the iterable protocl is a way to define objects as iterable, meaning, that they can be loo9ped over using the 'for...of' loop. 
An iterable object is any object that implements the 'symbol.iterator' method. This method should return an iterator object that conforms to iterator protocol.


The iterator protocol defines how to access the elements of an itrable object one by one.
An iterator object must implement the `next()` method, which returns an object with two properties:
`value`, which is the next element in the iteration, and `done`, which is a boolean value indicating whether the end of the iteration has been reached.

To create an iterable object in JavaScript, you need to define the `Symbol.iterator` method on the object.
This method should return an iterator object.
